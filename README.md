#### About Me

I'm @efrec.
I work in IT as T2 support and as a newbie SRE (with the usual extra hats).
I'm a former physics nerd (semi-reformed), occasional game dev, and full-time supporter of inclusivity.

It's important to me to continue learning and improving on myself, and I love to see people around me doing the same.
Right now, I am going back to coursework in my understudied areas of csci to become a true student of my work.
My hobby projects lately, though, are split between daily tasking and DX and improving as a developer.
